# MATH % AND / CALCULATOR
# 
# To understand this mechanism try to change variable "number1" to numbers from 1-10.
# MADE BY VALENTIN V.

# 1 % 100   (ALSO CAN MEAN 1 IN 100; ONLY ONE 0 FROM RANGE OF 1 TO 100, WHICH IS 100 % 100)


number1 = 1
number2 = 100

new_line = '\n'

print( new_line, "__Calculator of dividing__", new_line)

print(f"Number 1 : ", number1, new_line, "Number 2 : ", number2, new_line)

print(f"% dividing number: ", number1 % number2) 

print(f"/ dividing number :", number1 / number2)

print(new_line)



# WHAT IT DOES:

# EXAMPLE: 

# 16 % 8 = 0
# 17 % 8 = 1
# 18 % 8 = 2
# 19 % 8 = 3
# 20 % 8 = 4
# 21 % 8 = 5
# 22 % 8 = 6
# 23 % 8 = 7
# 24 % 8 = 0        # 0 BECAUSE 24 / 8 = 3.0 (NUMBER AFTER DOT(.) is 0 )
